Blueprint is an educational board game inspired by Snakes and Ladders that focuses on the role of engineers in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Players move across a development-themed board where progress and setbacks represent real-world engineering successes and challenges. Advancements symbolize innovations and effective engineering solutions, while regressions reflect poor planning, system failures, or unsustainable practices. Through this design, the game helps students understand how engineering decisions can either accelerate or hinder sustainable development.
